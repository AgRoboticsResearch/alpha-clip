# Alpha-CLIP

## üõ†Ô∏èUsage

### Installation
our model is based on [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP), please first prepare environment for CLIP, then directly install Alpha-CLIP.

```shell
pip install -e .
```

install loralib

```shell
pip install loralib
```

### how to use
download model from [model-zoo](https://github.com/SunzeY/AlphaCLIP/blob/main/model-zoo.md) and place it under `checkpoints`.

```python
import alpha_clip
alpha_clip.load("ViT-B/16", alpha_vision_ckpt_pth="checkpoints/clip_b16_grit1m_fultune_8xe.pth", device="cpu"), 
image_features = model.visual(image, alpha)
```
`alpha` need to be normalized via transforms when using `binary_mask` in (0, 1)
```python
mask_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(), 
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.Normalize(0.5, 0.26)
])
alpha = mask_transform(binary_mask * 255)
```
